# Lloyd-s-Algorithm
For my APSC 200 class, we were given a few algorithm options to choose from. 
And from the chosen algorithm we had to pick a real life situation to apply it to, and then run a simulation representing the situation. 
We chose to implement Lloyd's algorithm for our project.

This algorithm allows for optimal displacements of agents accross a field so that its their distance from each other is 
proportional to the density map of our problem. 

Because the situation that we picked for our project was Forest Fires, the density map represented the density of the fire at each point 
of the forest.
